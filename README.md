# Regis
This is the first version of my register app, which has no graphic interface and runs in the shell. 
This is a basic app that Iâ€™ve done to learn the basics of database integration and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Libs

| Lib                   | Version |
|:----------------------|---------|
|matplotlib             |    3.7.1|
|mysql                  |    0.0.3|
|mysql-connector        |    2.2.9|
|mysql-connector-python |   8.0.33|
|numpy                  |   1.25.0|
|python-dotenv          |    1.0.0|

## How to execute

- **After installing all libs you need to activate your virtual environment:** <br/>
On Command Prompt `python\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` <br/>
OR <br/>
On PowerShell `python\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` <br/>

- **After activated, you can run the program:** `python Main.py` <br/>

- **To deactivate your virtual environment, you can run:** <br/>
Command Prompt: `deactivate.bat` <br/>
OR <br/>
